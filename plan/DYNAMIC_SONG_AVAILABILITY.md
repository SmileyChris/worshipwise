# Dynamic Song Availability System

**Status**: üìã **FUTURE ENHANCEMENT** - Advanced feature planned for Sprint 8-10

## Overview

This plan outlines an advanced dynamic song availability system that goes beyond simple day-counting to provide intelligent, context-aware recommendations for worship song selection. The system will evolve the current green/yellow/red availability indicators into a sophisticated recommendation engine.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Foundation ‚úÖ

- **Database Schema**: Complete song usage tracking with `song_usage` collection
- **Basic Status Calculation**: 14/28-day thresholds for recent/caution/available
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded badges in song cards
- **Automatic Tracking**: Usage recorded when setlists are marked complete
- **Batch Operations**: API supports bulk usage lookups

### Current Limitations ‚ùå

- Fixed thresholds (14/28 days) don't account for church-specific patterns
- No consideration of service frequency or seasonal variations
- No advanced metrics like usage frequency, trending, or predictive analysis
- No warnings during setlist creation for recently used songs
- Bug: API queries `usage_date` but schema uses `used_date`

## Dynamic Availability Factors

### 1. **Temporal Factors**

- **Days Since Last Use**: Base factor (current system)
- **Service Frequency**: Weekly vs bi-weekly vs monthly churches
- **Usage Frequency**: How often the song is typically used
- **Seasonal Context**: Christmas, Easter, special seasons
- **Recent Trend**: Increasing vs decreasing usage

### 2. **Contextual Factors**

- **Service Type**: Sunday morning vs evening vs midweek
- **Worship Leader Preference**: Different leaders have different repertoires
- **Key Compatibility**: Songs that work well together in same key
- **Tempo Flow**: Fast/slow song transitions in worship sets
- **Congregation Familiarity**: New songs vs established favorites

### 3. **Statistical Factors**

- **Historical Usage Patterns**: Seasonal and yearly trends
- **Rotation Health**: Even distribution across song library
- **Overuse Prevention**: Detect songs becoming too frequent
- **Underuse Detection**: Identify neglected songs
- **Predictive Modeling**: ML-based availability scoring

### 4. **Church-Specific Factors**

- **Custom Thresholds**: Configurable by church size/culture
- **Special Events**: Baptisms, communion, special services
- **Music Team Capacity**: Available musicians and their abilities
- **Copyright Considerations**: CCLI reporting and compliance

## System Architecture

### 1. **Availability Scoring Engine**

```typescript
interface AvailabilityScore {
	score: number; // 0-100 (higher = more available)
	confidence: number; // 0-100 (confidence in the score)
	factors: FactorWeights; // Breakdown of contributing factors
	recommendation: AvailabilityRecommendation;
}

interface AvailabilityRecommendation {
	status: 'highly_recommended' | 'recommended' | 'caution' | 'avoid';
	reasons: string[]; // Human-readable explanations
	suggestedDate?: Date; // When to consider using again
	alternatives?: string[]; // Similar songs to consider instead
}
```

### 2. **Configurable Scoring Factors**

```typescript
interface ChurchAvailabilityConfig {
	// Temporal settings
	minDaysBetweenUse: number; // Minimum rest period
	cautionThreshold: number; // Days for caution status
	serviceFrequency: 'weekly' | 'biweekly' | 'monthly';

	// Weighting factors (0-1)
	temporal_weight: number; // How much time matters
	frequency_weight: number; // How much usage frequency matters
	seasonal_weight: number; // How much season matters
	leader_preference_weight: number; // How much leader preference matters

	// Advanced settings
	enable_ml_predictions: boolean;
	rotation_health_target: number; // Target usage distribution
	new_song_boost: number; // Boost for newer songs
}
```

### 3. **Data Collection Enhancement**

#### New Fields in `song_usage` Collection:

```javascript
// Additional fields to track
service_attendance: number; // How many people heard it
song_effectiveness: number; // 1-5 rating (optional)
weather_impact: string; // Indoor/outdoor service considerations
special_event_tag: string; // Christmas, Easter, baptism, etc.
```

#### Real-time Analytics:

- Usage pattern detection
- Anomaly identification (suddenly popular/unpopular songs)
- Predictive modeling for future recommendations

### 4. **Machine Learning Components**

#### Usage Pattern Analysis:

- Seasonal usage clustering
- Worship leader preference modeling
- Congregation response prediction
- Optimal rotation timing

#### Recommendation Engine:

- Collaborative filtering based on similar churches
- Content-based filtering using song attributes
- Hybrid approach combining multiple algorithms
- Continuous learning from user feedback
