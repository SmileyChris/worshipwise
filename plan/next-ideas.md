We should use svelte 4 css theme primary and secondary colors. The primary color is the logo text color. The logo svg yellow is the secondary color.

The songs page should have the categories as cards containing the songs.

Songs cards should redirect to a song details page where you can details, last usages, some related charts maybe.

Have a state for services. You can be editing a service in which case it you can add songs directly to it from the songs page.

It would be nice to have a sidebar on the songs page to show popular songs (overall) and popular songs for you.
