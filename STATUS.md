# PocketBase Mock System Improvements - Current Status

## Completed Work

### ✅ Enhanced PocketBase Mock Infrastructure
- **Enhanced `tests/helpers/pb-mock.ts`** with missing methods:
  - Added `getFirstListItem()` and `authWithOAuth2()` methods
  - Added standardized error helpers (`pbErrors` object)
  - Added fluent setup API (`setupMockPb()`)
  - Improved type safety and method coverage

### ✅ Created Type-Safe Mock Factories
- **Created `tests/helpers/mock-builders.ts`** with simple factory functions:
  - `mockUser()`, `mockChurch()`, `mockMembership()`, `mockSong()`, `mockService()`, `mockServiceSong()`
  - Simple object-based factories (not heavy builder pattern as initially implemented)
  - Automatic ID generation with counters
  - Sensible defaults with override support
  - Helper functions for common patterns (`mockAdmin()`, `mockLeader()`, etc.)

### ✅ Updated Testing Documentation
- **Enhanced `plan/TESTING_GUIDE.md`** with new mock patterns and examples
- Documented the improved PocketBase mocking approach
- Added guidelines for using the new factory functions

### ✅ Migrated Admin Pages to Correct Collections
- **Fixed admin API and pages** to use `church_memberships` instead of old `profiles` collection
- Updated `src/lib/api/admin.ts` for proper church-scoped multi-tenancy
- Fixed `src/routes/(app)/admin/churches/+page.svelte` to use correct collection

## Current Issues

### ❌ Test Migration Blocked by Vitest Hoisting
The attempt to migrate existing tests to use the new centralized mock system encountered **Vitest module hoisting issues**:

**Error**: `Cannot access 'mockPb' before initialization`
- **Root Cause**: `vi.mock()` calls are hoisted to the top of the file, but reference variables defined later
- **Affected File**: `src/lib/api/churches.test.ts` 
- **Impact**: Cannot use the new mock builders in server tests due to import resolution conflicts

### ❌ Test Suite Status
- **26 tests failing** across the test suite
- **575 total tests** with 549 passing
- Most failures are **unrelated to the mock improvements** (existing issues)
- Churches test specifically fails due to hoisting issues described above

## Next Steps Required

### 1. Resolve Vitest Hoisting Issues
**Options to investigate**:
- Use `vi.hoisted()` for mock definitions (Vitest recommended approach)
- Move mock setup to separate setup files that are imported
- Use dynamic imports in `beforeEach` hooks
- Consider different test structure that avoids hoisting conflicts

### 2. Complete Test Migration
**Remaining tasks**:
- Migrate existing tests to use centralized mock system (currently marked as pending in todo)
- Update tests to use the new factory functions consistently
- Ensure all PocketBase mocking follows the standardized patterns

### 3. Fix Existing Test Failures
**Investigation needed**:
- Review the 26 failing tests to determine if they're related to recent changes
- Address any regressions introduced during the mock system improvements
- Ensure test isolation and proper cleanup

### 4. Validate Mock System Integration
**Testing required**:
- Verify the enhanced mock system works across all test environments
- Test both client and server test configurations
- Ensure mock builders work in both unit and integration tests

## Technical Context

### Mock System Architecture
- **Multi-project Vitest setup**: Client (jsdom) + Server (node) environments
- **Centralized mocking**: All PocketBase mocks should use shared infrastructure
- **Type safety**: All mocks should be fully typed with TypeScript
- **Factory pattern**: Simple object factories with override support

### Key Files Modified
- `tests/helpers/pb-mock.ts` - Enhanced core mock infrastructure
- `tests/helpers/mock-builders.ts` - New type-safe factory functions  
- `plan/TESTING_GUIDE.md` - Updated documentation
- `src/lib/api/admin.ts` - Fixed collection usage
- `src/routes/(app)/admin/churches/+page.svelte` - Fixed admin pages
- `src/lib/api/churches.test.ts` - Attempted migration (blocked by hoisting)

## Recommended Approach

1. **Research Vitest hoisting solutions** - Review Vitest docs for recommended patterns
2. **Implement hoisting-safe mock setup** - Use `vi.hoisted()` or alternative approach
3. **Complete test migration systematically** - One test file at a time
4. **Verify test suite stability** - Ensure all tests pass after migration
5. **Update development roadmap** - Mark mock improvements as completed

The core infrastructure improvements are solid and ready for use - the main blocker is resolving the Vitest hoisting behavior to complete the test migration.
